# Systems.app - Frontend

## Overview

The Systems.app frontend is a React-based web application designed to help users identify countries that align with their personal values. Through a series of dropdown modal questions, users input their preferences and values, which are used to recommend countries tailored to their responses. This project highlights my ability to create dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing web applications with secure user authentication and full CRUD functionality.

## Features

- **Questionnaire System**:

  - A series of dropdown modals ask users about their values and preferences.
  - Based on user responses, the app dynamically recommends countries that align with their inputs.

- **Country Management**:

  - Logged-in users can:
    - Add new countries to the database.
    - Update existing country information.
    - Delete countries from the list.
  - Non-authenticated users can view available countries but cannot make modifications.

- **Secure Authentication**:

  - Only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on countries.
  - Non-authenticated users can still access the questionnaire and view the results.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling**:
  - A modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS ensures a visually appealing user interface.
  - Dropdown modals and interactive elements are styled for an intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building a dynamic, component-based user interface.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation between the questionnaire and country information.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and customizable styling.
- **Authentication**: Ensures secure access control for CRUD operations.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with a Rails backend for data retrieval and state synchronization.
